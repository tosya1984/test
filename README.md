##3 About me:
*My name is Anton, I am 37 years old, I live in Ukraine in the village Pesochin, Kharkiv region. I am married and have two children. Currently I work as a doctor of ultrasound diagnostics and a surgeon. In 2007 graduated from Kharkov State Medical University. Since my school days I wanted to become a programmer, at school I made simple websites in html, css and php. But life turned out so that I went on to study to be a doctor. In medicine I achieved great success, but still the thought of doing programming did not leave me all these years, and I decided to leave medicine and do the business that I had dreamed of since my school days. And I made up my mind). I am currently learning html, css, javascript, react. At first, I studied independently using books and materials from the Internet, now I study remotely at the courses "javascript / front end" at the "RS school". It takes almost all my free time after work and even more, but it brings a lot of pleasure and  feeling that I am getting closer and closer to my goal and dream! I have the desire, ability and motivation to move on in this direction!*
